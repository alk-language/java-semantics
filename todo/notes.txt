- Solved a bug in which a return statement was not skipped if another return statement was previously used
- Solved a bug in which methods like pushBack/pushFront were pushing referances instead of values
- Reworked on relational and equality operators (kept only == and < as mandatory operators)
- Added the builtin function: singletonSet(X)
- Added the compound operators: += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= &= |=
- Added converting functions: int(X), float(X)
- Reformated the printing of structures, lists, arrays and sets
