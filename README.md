# Quick setup

1. Install the latest version of Java. Alk works now on Java 1.8.
2. Download the jar inside the releases folder, it is enough to make Alk run.

# Example

There is also a short example inside of the realeases folder, including an example command line, used for executing Alk. The one follows:

java -jar alk.jar -a "algorithm.alk" \[-i "input.in"\]

Where "algorithm.alk" represents the path towards the file containing the algorithm. The second option is not mandatory and includes an initial configuration.
